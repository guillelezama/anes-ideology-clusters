## Methodology
Data: ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted percentages/means use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
Ideology features: seven domains (abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, religion). All items sign-aligned so higher = more conservative. We exclude leader/candidate evaluations, issue salience, and “party better on issue”.
Missingness: ANES negatives → missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% ideology items. Median impute per feature.
Scaling & clustering: z-scores; K chosen by silhouette over K=12…20; K-means with many starts.
Summaries: per cluster — weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean and p10–p90, weighted gender shares, weighted college/no-college, an age KDE image, population share.
Homogeneity: domain z-means and SDs; plus average z-distance to centroid and mean per-feature z-std.
LLM text: built from domain means/SDs and topline stats; it must reference homogeneity and discuss both means and variation.
