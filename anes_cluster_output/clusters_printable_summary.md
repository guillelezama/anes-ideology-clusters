## Methodology

**Data.** ANES 2024 Time Series (public release). Percentages and means use the first available pre-election weight in the file. Clustering itself is unweighted (standard K-means).

**Ideology features.** Variables cover seven domains: abortion, immigration, redistribution/government role, environment/climate, health insurance, defense spending, and religiosity (attendance). All items are sign-aligned so higher = more conservative. We exclude leader evaluations, candidate thermometers, issue salience, and “which party is better” items.

**Missingness.** ANES negative codes are treated as missing. Respondents must answer ≥60% of ideology items. Remaining gaps are median-imputed per variable before clustering.

**Scaling and clustering.** Features are standardized (z-scores). We select K by maximizing silhouette over K=10…20, then fit K-means with multiple starts.

**Summaries.** For each cluster we report: weighted % intending to vote Harris, weighted mean party ID (1=Strong Dem … 7=Strong Rep), a gender breakdown (weighted), an age density plot (for shape; unweighted), and an education histogram (College vs No college, weighted).

**Domain indices & homogeneity.** For each domain we average item z-scores (sign-aligned). Homogeneity is summarized by: (1) average z-distance to centroid, (2) mean per-feature z-std within cluster, and (3) dispersion across domain indices.

**LLM text.** A short, neutral description is generated from the domain indices and ideology item means only. The prompt asks: “Describe their views on abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion, but only based on the data you see.” The OpenAI API key is supplied externally via a variable named `key`.
