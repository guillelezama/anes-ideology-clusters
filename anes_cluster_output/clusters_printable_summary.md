## Methodology

**Data.** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted percentages/means use the first available pre-election weight in the file. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).

**Ideology features.** Seven domains: abortion, immigration, redistribution/government role, environment/climate, health insurance, defense spending, and religiosity. All items are sign-aligned so higher = more conservative. We exclude leader/candidate evaluations, issue salience, and “party better on issue”.

**Missingness.** ANES negative codes → missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% answered ideology items. Median impute per feature for clustering.

**Scaling & clustering.** Standardize features (z). Choose K by max silhouette over K=10…20, then fit K-means (multiple starts).

**Summaries.** For each cluster: weighted % Harris, weighted mean party ID, weighted gender shares, weighted college vs no-college shares, a GitHub-embedded age KDE, and population share (weighted).

**Domain indices & homogeneity.** Domain index = mean of sign-aligned item z-scores within domain. Homogeneity: (1) avg z-distance to centroid, (2) mean per-feature z-std, (3) dispersion across domain indices.

**LLM text.** The summary is generated strictly from domain indices (signs & magnitudes) with the instruction: “Describe their views on abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion, but only based on the data you see.” Positive domain z = more conservative; negative = more liberal.
