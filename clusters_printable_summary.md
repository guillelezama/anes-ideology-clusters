![Age KDE — Cluster 8](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster8.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 8 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.21), immigration (+0.59), redistribution (+0.27), environment (+0.31), efficacy/trust/corruption (+0.79), democracy (+0.47), vaccines (+0.72), trans laws (+0.44), minority representation (+0.55), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.54). Religion (-0.32), Israel aid (-0.47), and Ukraine aid (-1.01) lean more liberal. Variation is moderate to high across domains, notably high for vaccines (SD=1.16) and defense (SD=1.01), indicating some heterogeneity within the cluster. Economic vulnerability is moderate (mean 2.79), and party ID strongly skews conservative (Trump 70.8%), consistent with the ideological profile.

**Avg Party ID:** 6.02 (p10–p90: 5.0–7.0)
**Vote (weighted, normalized):** Harris 4.6% · Trump 85.7% · Other 2.7% · Non-voting 4.2% · Unknown 2.7%
**Gender (weighted):** Man 54.9% · Woman 44.8% · Nonbinary 0.0% · Other 0.3%

**Education (weighted):** College 63.3% | No college 36.4%
**Economic vulnerability (higher=worse):** mean 2.66 (p20–p80: 2.0-4.0)
**Homogeneity:** avg z-distance 7.157, feature z-std 0.9717, domain dispersion 0.4043
![Age KDE — Cluster 13](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster13.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 13 exhibits a predominantly conservative ideology, with positive mean z-scores on most domains such as religion (+1.02), Israel aid (+0.97), immigration (+0.60), trans laws (+0.70), and vaccines (+0.54). Domains like defense (-0.24), democracy (-0.28), and Ukraine aid (-0.33) show slight liberal leanings, while health (-0.11) and racial disparity (-0.03) are near neutral. Variation is moderate to high in domains like vaccines (SD=1.18) and religion (SD=0.88), indicating some internal diversity, but overall homogeneity is relatively high (avg z-dist 7.157, feature z-std 0.972). The group is strongly aligned with Trump (85.7%) and has moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.66), suggesting conservative views coexist with some economic concerns.

![Age KDE — Cluster 12](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster12.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 12 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.35), immigration (+0.86), redistribution (+0.45), environment (+0.48), Israel aid (+0.34), Ukraine aid (+0.27), trans laws (+0.22), trans additional (+0.86), minority representation (+0.75), DEI/affirmative action (+0.79), and threat (+0.55). Domains related to defense (-0.26), religion (-0.21), efficacy/trust/corruption (-0.24), democracy (-0.28), health (-0.14), vaccines (-0.09), and racial disparity (0.00) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high in religion (0.70), vaccines (0.80), trans laws (1.01), and Israel aid (0.74), indicating some internal diversity, while domains like democracy (0.28) and DEI (0.26) show more homogeneity. The cluster is strongly aligned with Trump (83.9%) and has moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.74), suggesting conservative views coexist with some economic concerns.

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Domains (pre + post):** abortion; immigration (PRE + POST); redistribution; environment; health; defense; religion; racial disparity; efficacy/trust/corruption; democracy; vaccines (neutral middle handled); Israel aid; Ukraine aid; gay rights; trans laws (+ military/bathroom/discrimination); DEI/affirmative; minority representation; threat (China/Russia/Mexico/Iran as-is; Japan/Israel flipped).
- **Coding:** Conservative-leaning options coded higher; racial disparity kept interpretive (higher = Whites not advantaged; Blacks disadvantaged). Threat domain flips Japan/Israel so higher = less threat.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes set to missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% items answered. Median impute per feature for clustering inputs.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Vote shares:** One denominator (cluster’s total weight) so Harris + Trump + Other + Non-voting + Unknown = 100%; use post reported vote/turnout when available, else pre intention.
- **Outputs:** normalized vote shares; party-ID mean + p10–p90; gender & race/Hispanic shares; college/no-college; economic vulnerability (mean & p20–p80); age KDE; population share (weighted) & sample size (n).
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
