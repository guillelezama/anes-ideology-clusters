## Cross-cluster comparison
The provided data delineates 18 distinct ideology clusters characterized by their population shares, party identification (PID) distributions, vote shares for Harris and Trump, educational attainment, and positions across seven policy domains: abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion. A comparative analysis reveals several clusters that are broadly similar across most domains but diverge notably on one or two dimensions, as well as clusters that stand out due to their unique ideological profiles.

Clusters 0 and 5, for example, share several similarities. Both have relatively low mean PID scores (4.67 and 2.77 respectively), indicating a moderate Democratic leaning, and both exhibit negative stances on abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion domains, reflecting generally conservative or moderate positions. Their Harris vote shares are 29.6% and 80.6%, respectively, with cluster 5 showing a stronger Democratic preference. Notably, cluster 5 has a higher college attainment rate (77.6% vs. 61.7%) and a slightly more negative position on immigration (-0.47 vs. 0.57 in cluster 0, where cluster 0 is actually positive), marking immigration as a key contrasting dimension. Cluster 0 is more positive on immigration (0.57), suggesting a more pro-immigration stance compared to cluster 5’s opposition. This contrast is significant given their otherwise similar moderate-to-conservative profiles.

Clusters 2 and 4 both exhibit strong Republican leanings, with mean PID scores of 6.07 and 5.93, and high Trump vote shares (94.4% and 85.4%). Both clusters hold positive positions on abortion (0.23 and 0.72) and immigration (1.12 and 0.64), indicating conservative stances on these issues. However, cluster 4 is somewhat more moderate on redistribution (0.30) and environment (0.29) compared to cluster 2’s more positive redistribution (0.60) and environment (0.47) scores. Additionally, cluster 4’s religion score is more negative (-0.46) than cluster 2’s (-0.31), suggesting a slightly less religiously conservative orientation. These differences highlight nuanced ideological distinctions within strongly Republican clusters, particularly on redistribution and religion.

Clusters 1 and 13 both demonstrate strong Democratic leanings, with mean PID scores of 2.95 and 1.95, and high Harris vote shares (75.9% and 92.2%). Both clusters hold negative positions across abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion domains, consistent with liberal policy preferences. Cluster 13, however, is more uniformly liberal, with stronger negative scores on immigration (-0.92 vs. -0.29) and redistribution (-0.53 vs. -0.32), and a higher college attainment rate (82.7% vs. 58.8%). Cluster 1 shows a notably high positive defense score (2.64), contrasting with cluster 13’s negative defense stance (-0.41). This defense domain divergence is a key differentiator, indicating that cluster 1 may prioritize defense more than cluster 13 despite similar liberal orientations elsewhere.

Clusters 3 and 8 present another interesting comparison. Both have relatively small population shares (3.3% and 3.6%) and moderate PID means (3.87 and 4.22), with mixed vote shares for Harris and Trump (44.1% vs. 38.0% Harris; 50.8% vs. 59.1% Trump). Both clusters show positive positions on environment (1.21 and 0.40) and health (1.21 and 0.35), indicating progressive stances on these domains. However, cluster 3 has a notably high defense score (1.77) compared to cluster 8’s moderate defense score (0.62), and cluster 8 exhibits a strong positive abortion score (2.22) while cluster 3’s abortion score is negative (-0.14). These contrasts suggest that while both clusters share progressive views on environment and health, they diverge sharply on abortion and defense, with cluster 8 being more socially conservative on abortion and cluster 3 more hawkish on defense.

Finally, clusters 6 and 9 both have moderate PID means (4.24 and 4.36) and similar Trump vote shares (37.5% and 57.1%), but differ markedly in health and defense domains. Cluster 6 has extremely high positive scores on health (2.76) and defense (2.12), whereas cluster 9 shows a very high health score (3.16) but a near-neutral defense score (0.04). Additionally, cluster 6’s abortion score is strongly positive (2.12), contrasting with cluster 9’s slightly negative abortion score (-0.10). These differences highlight that despite similar partisan leanings and vote shares, clusters 6 and 9 diverge significantly on social and defense issues.

In summary, the clusters reveal patterns of ideological similarity punctuated by key domain-specific contrasts. Clusters with comparable partisan identities and vote shares often differ notably on defense, abortion, immigration, or religion domains. These distinctions underscore the multidimensional nature of political ideology within the population, with nuanced variations that are not fully captured by party identification or vote choice alone. Population shares range widely, with cluster 13 representing the largest Democratic-leaning group at 19.2%, while clusters such as 15 and 17 represent smaller but distinct ideological segments. College attainment and nonvoting rates also vary, providing additional context for understanding the composition and potential influence of each cluster.

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight in the file. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Ideology features:** Seven domains (abortion, immigration, redistribution/government role, environment/climate, health insurance, defense spending, religiosity). Signs aligned so higher = more conservative. Leader/candidate evaluations, issue salience, and “party better on issue” are excluded.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes treated as missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% ideology items. Median impute per feature for clustering.
- **Scaling & clustering:** Standardize features (z). Choose K by silhouette over K=12…20; fit K-means with many starts.
- **Per-cluster outputs:** weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean and p10–p90, weighted gender shares, weighted college/no-college, age KDE image, **population share (weighted)** and **sample size (n)**.
- **Homogeneity:** Report (1) average z-distance to centroid, (2) mean per-feature z-std, (3) dispersion across domain z-means.
- **LLM text:** Summaries and comparison are generated from the domain means/SDs and toplines; they must reference homogeneity and discuss both means and variation. The OpenAI API key is supplied externally via a variable named `key`.
