## Cross-cluster comparison
The provided data delineates 18 distinct ideology clusters characterized by their population shares, party identification (PID) distributions, vote shares in Harris and Trump polls, educational attainment, and mean positions across seven policy domains: abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion. A comparative analysis reveals several clusters that are broadly similar across most domains but diverge notably on one or two dimensions, as well as clusters that differ more comprehensively.

Clusters 0 and 7 exhibit considerable similarity in their moderate-to-conservative stances across most domains, with both showing slightly negative or near-neutral positions on abortion, redistribution, environment, health, defense, and religion. Cluster 0 (10.4% population share, PID mean 4.67) leans somewhat more Republican in vote share (Trump 60.6%) compared to cluster 7 (4.6% population share, PID mean 3.63, Trump 45.0%). The key contrast lies in immigration: cluster 0 holds a moderately positive position (0.57), indicating a more restrictive or conservative stance, whereas cluster 7 is nearly neutral (-0.002). This suggests that while both clusters share a generally conservative profile, cluster 0 is more restrictive on immigration.

Clusters 2 and 4 both represent strongly Republican-leaning groups with high Trump support (94.4% and 85.4%, respectively) and PID means above 5.9. They share positive positions on abortion (0.23 and 0.72), immigration (1.12 and 0.64), and redistribution (0.60 and 0.30), indicating conservative or right-leaning views on these issues. However, cluster 4 is somewhat less supportive of redistribution and environment policies than cluster 2, with cluster 4’s environment position near neutral (0.29) versus cluster 2’s more positive stance (0.47). Additionally, cluster 4 exhibits a more negative position on religion (-0.46) compared to cluster 2 (-0.31), suggesting subtle differences in religious attitudes despite overall similarity.

Clusters 1 and 5 both lean Democratic with PID means below 3.0 and high Harris vote shares (75.9% and 80.6%). They share negative positions on abortion, immigration, environment, health, defense, and religion, consistent with liberal policy preferences. The notable contrast is in redistribution: cluster 1 holds a more negative position (-0.32), indicating less support for redistribution, whereas cluster 5 is slightly positive (0.11), suggesting more openness to redistribution policies. This difference may reflect varying economic policy attitudes within a broadly liberal constituency.

Clusters 3 and 6, both smaller groups with moderate PID means (3.87 and 4.24) and mixed vote shares (Harris 44.1% and 44.4%, Trump 50.8% and 37.5%), show some alignment on immigration and religion but diverge sharply on health and defense. Cluster 6 exhibits strongly positive positions on health (2.76) and defense (2.12), indicating strong support for expansive policies or spending in these areas, whereas cluster 3 also shows positive but less extreme positions (health 1.21, defense 1.77). Additionally, cluster 6’s abortion stance is strongly positive (2.12), contrasting with cluster 3’s near-neutral to slightly negative position (-0.14). These differences highlight distinct emphases on social and defense policies despite some shared moderate partisan identification.

Cluster 13 stands out as the largest single cluster (19.2% population share) with a strongly Democratic PID mean (1.95) and very high Harris vote share (92.2%). It consistently holds negative positions across all domains, reflecting liberal stances on abortion (-0.52), immigration (-0.92), redistribution (-0.53), environment (-0.63), health (-0.37), defense (-0.41), and religion (-0.68). This cluster contrasts sharply with cluster 2, a smaller but strongly Republican group (6.0% share, PID mean 6.07), which holds positive positions on abortion, immigration, redistribution, and environment, underscoring the polarized nature of these two large ideological segments.

In summary, the clusters reveal a spectrum of ideological profiles with some groups sharing broad policy orientations but differing on key issues such as immigration, redistribution, or religion. Clusters 0 and 7, as well as 2 and 4, exemplify this pattern of similarity with targeted contrasts. Meanwhile, clusters 1 and 5 illustrate intra-liberal variation on economic redistribution. The largest clusters, 13 and 2, represent the ideological poles with consistent and opposing positions across domains, reflecting the broader partisan divide in the population. Population shares and vote distributions further contextualize these clusters, indicating their relative size and electoral significance.

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight in the file. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Ideology features:** Seven domains (abortion, immigration, redistribution/government role, environment/climate, health insurance, defense spending, religiosity). Signs aligned so higher = more conservative. Leader/candidate evaluations, issue salience, and “party better on issue” are excluded.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes treated as missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% ideology items. Median impute per feature for clustering.
- **Scaling & clustering:** Standardize features (z). Choose K by silhouette over K=12…20; fit K-means with many starts.
- **Per-cluster outputs:** weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean and p10–p90, weighted gender shares, weighted college/no-college, age KDE image, **population share (weighted)** and **sample size (n)**.
- **Homogeneity:** Report (1) average z-distance to centroid, (2) mean per-feature z-std, (3) dispersion across domain z-means.
- **LLM text:** Summaries and comparison are generated from the domain means/SDs and toplines; they must reference homogeneity and discuss both means and variation. The OpenAI API key is supplied externally via a variable named `key`.
