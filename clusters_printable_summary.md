## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Domains (pre + post):** abortion; immigration; redistribution; environment; health; defense; religion; racial disparity; efficacy/trust/corruption; democracy; vaccines (neutral middle handled); Israel aid; Ukraine aid; gay rights; **trans rights (all trans items merged)**; DEI/affirmative; minority representation; **threat** (China/Russia/Mexico/Iran as-is; Japan/Israel flipped).
- **Coding:** Conservative-leaning options coded higher; racial disparity kept interpretive (higher = Whites not advantaged; Blacks disadvantaged). The threat domain is summarized neutrally as perceived threat (no ideological labeling).
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes set to missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% items answered. Median impute per feature for clustering inputs.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Vote shares:** One denominator (cluster’s total weight): Harris + Trump + Other + Non-voting + Unknown = 100%; use post reported vote/turnout when available, else pre intention.
- **Outputs:** normalized vote shares; party-ID mean + p10–p90; gender & race/Hispanic shares; college/no-college; economic vulnerability (mean & p20–p80); age KDE; population share (weighted) & sample size (n).
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
