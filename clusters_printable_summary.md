![Age KDE — Cluster 7](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster7.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 7 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.33), immigration (+0.76), redistribution (+0.34), environment (+0.44), religion (+0.45), efficacy/trust/corruption (+0.86), and trans rights (+0.72). Domains like health (-0.15), defense (-0.20), democracy (-0.20), vaccines (-0.62), foreign policy (-0.15), and racial disparity (-0.01) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high, especially in religion (SD=1.03) and vaccines (SD=1.00), indicating heterogeneity in these areas, while efficacy/trust/corruption shows lower variation (SD=0.39). The cluster is politically homogeneous (Party ID mean 6.16, mostly Trump supporters) with moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.58).

## Cross-cluster comparison
Several clusters exhibit similarity across multiple domains yet diverge notably on one or two key dimensions. For instance, clusters 2 and 9 both represent sizable population shares (10.0% and 12.3%, respectively) with relatively low mean party identification scores (2.62 and 2.04), indicating a Democratic-leaning orientation. Both clusters show high vote shares for Harris (83.1% and 90.7%) and low support for Trump (11.9% and 2.6%), alongside high college attainment rates (79.3% and 79.5%) and moderate economic vulnerability (means of 2.57 and 2.79). However, cluster 9 has a slightly lower nonvoting rate (6.6% vs. 3.1%) and a marginally more homogeneous profile as indicated by a lower homog_avgdist (1.9225 vs. 2.1123). This suggests that while both clusters are strongly Democratic and well-educated, cluster 9 is somewhat more politically cohesive and less economically vulnerable.

Another pair worth comparing is clusters 4 and 15, both characterized by strong Republican leanings with high mean party ID scores (5.87 and 5.78) and substantial Trump vote shares (87.0% and 88.9%). Both clusters have moderate college attainment (60.9% and 66.0%) and similar economic vulnerability means (3.03 and 2.84). The key difference lies in population share and voter turnout: cluster 4 accounts for 7.7% of the population with a nonvoting rate of 8.8%, whereas cluster 15 comprises 6.4% with a slightly lower nonvoting rate of 5.9%. Additionally, cluster 15 exhibits a lower homog_avgdist (2.7762 vs. 2.5091), indicating marginally greater homogeneity. These contrasts suggest that while both clusters are Republican strongholds with comparable socioeconomic profiles, cluster 15 may represent a more politically engaged and cohesive subset.

Clusters 1 and 3 also share similarities in party ID range (means of 3.42 and 3.15) and moderate Trump vote shares (39.7% and 27.8%), with both showing elevated economic vulnerability (means of 3.67 and 3.31) and moderate college attainment (47.0% and 57.4%). However, cluster 1 has a notably higher nonvoting rate (17.4% vs. 12.6%) and a lower Harris vote share (48.5% compared to 63.3%). Furthermore, cluster 3 has a higher homog_dispers (0.7483 vs. 0.223), indicating greater internal diversity. These differences point to cluster 1 as a more economically vulnerable and less politically engaged group with a more dispersed profile, whereas cluster 3 appears somewhat more cohesive and politically active.

In summary, these comparisons reveal that clusters often align closely on party identification, vote shares, and socioeconomic indicators but can differ meaningfully in political engagement levels, population size, and internal homogeneity. Such distinctions are critical for understanding the nuanced composition of voter segments within the broader electorate.

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Conservative-high coding:** All listed issue items were recoded so higher = more conservative. See script comments by variable.
- **Domains:** abortion, immigration, redistribution, environment, health, defense, religion, racial disparity, efficacy/trust/corruption, democracy, vaccines, foreign policy, trans rights.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes → missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% ideology items. Median impute per feature.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Outputs:** weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean + p10–p90, gender & race/Hispanic shares, college/no-college, **economic vulnerability** (mean & p20–p80 from income summaries, inverted), age KDE, population share (weighted) & sample size.
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
- **LLM:** per-cluster summaries reference domain means/SDs and homogeneity; cross-cluster comparison summarizes similarities/differences.
