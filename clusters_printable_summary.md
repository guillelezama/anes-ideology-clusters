Notably, gay rights (+1.60) and trans laws (+0.63) show strong conservatism, while health (-0.13), defense (-0.18), and democracy (-0.30) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high in religion (SD=1.09), Israel aid (0.95), and vaccines (0.77), indicating some internal diversity, but racial disparity (0.18) and democracy (0.22) are more homogeneous. Economic vulnerability is moderate (mean 3.22), and party ID strongly favors Trump (62.5%), aligning with the conservative profile.

![Age KDE — Cluster 16](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster16.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 16 exhibits a predominantly conservative ideology, with positive mean z-scores on most domains such as religion (+0.97), Israel aid (+0.99), gay rights (+0.86), trans laws (+0.75), immigration (+0.65), and minority representation (+0.55). Exceptions include liberal-leaning means on health (-0.17), defense (-0.23), democracy (-0.24), vaccines (-0.54), and Ukraine aid (-0.42). Variation is moderate to high in domains like religion (SD=0.88), vaccines (1.05), and gay rights (1.01), indicating some internal diversity, while domains like redistribution (0.39) and DEI/affirmative action (0.36) show lower variation. The cluster is politically homogeneous (Party ID mean 6.09, mostly Trump supporters at 78.2%) with moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.68), suggesting a conservative group with some nuanced views on health and defense.

![Age KDE — Cluster 5](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster5.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 5 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.29), immigration (+0.79), redistribution (+0.48), environment (+0.48), gay rights (+0.54), trans laws (+0.34), minority representation (+0.78), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.78). Domains like health (-0.17), defense (-0.27), religion (-0.49), and democracy (-0.22) lean more liberal. Variation is moderate to high in domains such as vaccines (0.82 SD), gay rights (1.02 SD), and trans laws (0.93 SD), indicating some internal diversity, while racial disparity (0.20 SD) and DEI (0.25 SD) show more homogeneity. The group is strongly Republican-leaning (Trump 73.4%), with moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.84) and a high college education rate (67.3%).

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Domains (pre + post):** abortion; immigration (PRE + POST); redistribution; environment; health; defense; religion; racial disparity (V241728/29); efficacy/trust/corruption (V241726/37/38); democracy (V241731/743); vaccines (V241732); Israel aid (V241741); Ukraine aid (V241740); gay rights (V241381x/V241385x); trans laws (V241742); DEI/affirmative (V242237/241x/242); minority representation (V242526–29).
- **Coding:** Conservative-leaning options coded higher; racial disparity kept interpretive (higher = Whites **not** advantaged; Blacks **disadvantaged**). Israel/Ukraine are separate axes; both flipped so higher = more support.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes set to missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% items answered. Median impute per feature for clustering inputs.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Outputs:** per cluster — weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean + p10–p90, gender & race/Hispanic shares, college/no-college, economic vulnerability (mean & p20–p80 from income summary, inverted), age KDE, population share (weighted) & sample size (n).
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
- **LLM:** optional per-cluster summary from domain stats (set `key` before import to enable).
