**Homogeneity:** avg z-dist 3.973, feature z-std 0.614, domain dispersion 0.4314
![Age KDE — Cluster 15](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster15.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 15 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive mean z-scores on abortion (+0.53), immigration (+0.65), redistribution (+0.35), environment (+0.39), religion (+0.68), and minority representation (+0.70). Notably, gay rights (+1.60) and trans laws (+0.63) show strong conservatism. Domains like health (-0.13), defense (-0.18), and democracy (-0.30) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high in religion (SD=1.09), Israel aid (0.95), and vaccines (0.77), indicating some internal diversity, while racial disparity (0.18) and democracy (0.22) are more homogeneous. The group has a strong Democratic ID (mean 5.89) and moderate economic vulnerability (mean 3.22), suggesting economic concerns coexist with conservative social and policy attitudes.

![Age KDE — Cluster 16](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster16.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 16 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive mean z-scores on abortion (+0.47), immigration (+0.65), redistribution (+0.37), environment (+0.48), religion (+0.97), Israel aid (+0.99), gay rights (+0.86), trans laws (+0.75), minority representation (+0.55), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.74). Domains like health (-0.17), defense (-0.23), democracy (-0.24), vaccines (-0.54), Ukraine aid (-0.42), and racial disparity (-0.02) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high in religion (0.88 SD), vaccines (1.05 SD), Ukraine aid (0.93 SD), and gay rights (1.01 SD), indicating some internal diversity. The cluster is politically homogeneous (Party ID mean 6.09) with low economic vulnerability (mean 2.68), suggesting a relatively stable, conservative-leaning group with nuanced views on health, defense, and international aid.

![Age KDE — Cluster 5](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster5.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 5 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.29), immigration (+0.79), redistribution (+0.48), environment (+0.48), gay rights (+0.54), trans laws (+0.34), minority representation (+0.78), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.78). Domains like religion (-0.49), defense (-0.27), and democracy (-0.22) lean more liberal. Variation is moderate to high in domains such as gay rights (SD=1.02), vaccines (0.82), and Israel aid (0.86), indicating some internal diversity, while racial disparity (0.20) and DEI (0.25) show more consensus. The group is politically homogeneous (Party ID mean 6.17) with low economic vulnerability (mean 2.84), high college education (67.5%), and strong support for Harris (95%).

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Domains (pre + post):** abortion; immigration (PRE + POST); redistribution; environment; health; defense; religion; racial disparity (V241728/29); efficacy/trust/corruption (V241726/37/38); democracy (V241731/743); vaccines (V241732); Israel aid (V241741); Ukraine aid (V241740); gay rights (V241381x/V241385x); trans laws (V241742); DEI/affirmative (V242237/241x/242); minority representation (V242526–29).
- **Coding:** Conservative-leaning options coded higher; racial disparity kept interpretive (higher = Whites **not** advantaged; Blacks **disadvantaged**). Israel/Ukraine are separate axes; both flipped so higher = more support.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes set to missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% items answered. Median impute per feature for clustering inputs.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Outputs:** per cluster — weighted vote shares (Harris/Trump/Other/Non-voting), weighted party-ID mean + p10–p90, gender & race/Hispanic shares, college/no-college, economic vulnerability (mean & p20–p80 from income summary, inverted), age KDE, population share (weighted) & sample size (n).
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
- **LLM:** optional per-cluster summary and cross-cluster comparison from domain stats (set `key` before import to enable).
