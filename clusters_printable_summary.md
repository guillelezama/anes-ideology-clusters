**Economic vulnerability (higher=worse):** mean 3.22 (p20–p80: 2.0-4.0)
**Homogeneity:** avg z-dist 3.973, feature z-std 0.614, domain dispersion 0.4314
![Age KDE — Cluster 15](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster15.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 15 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive mean z-scores on abortion (+0.53), immigration (+0.65), redistribution (+0.35), environment (+0.39), religion (+0.68), and minority representation (+0.70). Notably, gay rights (+1.60) and trans laws (+0.63) show strong conservatism, while health (-0.13), defense (-0.18), and democracy (-0.30) lean slightly liberal. Variation is moderate to high in religion (SD=1.09), Israel aid (0.95), and vaccines (0.77), indicating some internal diversity, but racial disparity (0.18) and democracy (0.22) are more homogeneous. The group is heavily Trump-aligned (84%) with moderate economic vulnerability (mean 3.22), suggesting economic concerns may coexist with conservative social and political views.

**Homogeneity:** avg z-dist 6.66, feature z-std 0.9862, domain dispersion 0.4848
![Age KDE — Cluster 16](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster16.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 16 exhibits a predominantly conservative ideology, with positive mean z-scores on most domains such as religion (+0.97), Israel aid (+0.99), gay rights (+0.86), trans laws (+0.75), immigration (+0.65), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.74). Exceptions include liberal-leaning means on health (-0.17), defense (-0.23), democracy (-0.24), vaccines (-0.54), Ukraine aid (-0.42), and near-neutral racial disparity (-0.02). Variation is moderate to high in domains like religion (SD=0.88), vaccines (1.05), Ukraine aid (0.93), and gay rights (1.01), indicating some internal diversity, while others like DEI (0.36) and redistribution (0.39) show more homogeneity. The cluster is highly conservative politically (Party ID mean 6.09), with low Harris support (3.7%) and high Trump support (88.2%), moderate college education (64.3%), and moderate economic vulnerability (mean 2.68), suggesting economic factors may not strongly moderate their conservative stance.

## Cluster 5
**Population share (weighted):** 8.1%  ·  **Sample size (n):** 615
**Avg Party ID:** 6.17 (p10–p90: 5.0–7.0)
**Vote (weighted, normalized):** Harris 3.2% · Trump 81.9% · Other 3.4% · Non-voting 4.7% · Unknown 6.9%
**Gender (weighted):** Man 57.0% · Woman 42.7% · Nonbinary 0.1% · Other 0.0%
**Race & Hispanic (weighted):** White NH 82.7% · Black NH 1.0% · Hispanic 5.6% · Asian/NHPI NH 2.6% · Native/Other NH 0.1% · Multiracial NH 5.2%

**Economic vulnerability (higher=worse):** mean 2.84 (p20–p80: 2.0-4.0)
**Homogeneity:** avg z-dist 3.6062, feature z-std 0.5644, domain dispersion 0.3809
![Age KDE — Cluster 5](anes_cluster_output/plots/age_kdensity_cluster5.png)
**Ideology summary:** Cluster 5 exhibits a moderately conservative ideology overall, with positive means on abortion (+0.29), immigration (+0.79), redistribution (+0.48), environment (+0.48), gay rights (+0.54), trans laws (+0.34), minority representation (+0.78), and DEI/affirmative action (+0.78). Domains like health (-0.17), defense (-0.27), religion (-0.49), and democracy (-0.22) lean liberal. Variation is moderate to high in domains such as gay rights (SD=1.02), vaccines (0.82), and Israel aid (0.86), indicating heterogeneity, while racial disparity (0.20) and DEI (0.25) show more consensus. The group is politically conservative (Party ID mean 6.17) with low economic vulnerability (mean 2.84), suggesting economic security may support their ideological profile.

## Methodology
- **Data:** ANES 2024 Time Series. Weighted stats use the first available pre-election weight. Clustering is unweighted (K-means).
- **Domains (pre + post):** abortion; immigration (PRE + POST); redistribution; environment; health; defense; religion; racial disparity (V241728/29); efficacy/trust/corruption (V241726/37/38); democracy (V241731/743); vaccines (V241732); Israel aid (V241741); Ukraine aid (V241740); gay rights (V241381x/V241385x); trans laws (V241742); DEI/affirmative (V242237/241x/242); minority representation (V242526–29).
- **Coding:** Conservative-leaning options coded higher; racial disparity kept interpretive (higher = Whites **not** advantaged; Blacks **disadvantaged**). Israel/Ukraine are separate axes; both flipped so higher = more support.
- **Missingness:** Negative ANES codes set to missing. Keep respondents with ≥60% items answered. Median impute per feature for clustering inputs.
- **Scaling & clustering:** z-scores; K chosen by silhouette in [12,20]; K-means (multi-start).
- **Vote shares:** Computed on a single denominator (cluster’s total weight) so *Harris + Trump + Other + Non-voting + Unknown = 100%*, using post reported vote/turnout when available, else pre intention.
- **Outputs:** per cluster — normalized vote shares; weighted party-ID mean + p10–p90; gender & race/Hispanic shares; college/no-college; economic vulnerability (mean & p20–p80 from income summary, inverted); age KDE; population share (weighted) & sample size (n).
- **Homogeneity:** avg z-distance to centroid, mean per-feature z-std, dispersion across domain indices.
